# Task Delegation Guide

## Decision Matrix for Task Assignment

### Step 1: Identify Task Type

#### Product & Strategy Tasks
- **Requirements gathering** → Product Manager
- **User research** → Product Manager + UX Designer
- **Feature prioritization** → Product Manager + Tech Lead
- **Roadmap planning** → Product Manager + Tech Lead

#### Design Tasks
- **User experience design** → UX Designer
- **System architecture** → System Architect
- **Database design** → System Architect + Senior Engineer
- **API design** → System Architect + Senior Engineer

#### Development Tasks
- **Complex feature implementation** → Senior Engineer
- **Standard feature implementation** → Junior Engineer (with Senior oversight)
- **Bug fixes (critical)** → Senior Engineer
- **Bug fixes (minor)** → Junior Engineer
- **Code refactoring** → Senior Engineer + Junior Engineer
- **Performance optimization** → Senior Engineer + System Architect

#### Infrastructure & Operations
- **Deployment setup** → DevOps Engineer
- **Monitoring configuration** → DevOps Engineer + Senior Engineer
- **Infrastructure scaling** → DevOps Engineer + System Architect
- **CI/CD pipeline** → DevOps Engineer + Tech Lead

#### Quality Assurance
- **Test plan creation** → QA Engineer + Product Manager
- **Manual testing** → QA Engineer
- **Test automation** → QA Engineer + Senior Engineer
- **Performance testing** → QA Engineer + DevOps Engineer

#### Security & Compliance
- **Security audits** → Security Specialist
- **Vulnerability assessment** → Security Specialist + Senior Engineer
- **Compliance review** → Security Specialist + Product Manager
- **Incident response** → Security Specialist + DevOps Engineer + Tech Lead

#### Data & AI
- **Model development** → Data Scientist
- **Data pipeline creation** → Data Scientist + Senior Engineer
- **Model deployment** → Data Scientist + DevOps Engineer
- **AI performance monitoring** → Data Scientist + QA Engineer

### Step 2: Assess Complexity and Skills Required

#### Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Can be completed independently with minimal guidance
- **Moderate**: Requires some collaboration or specialized knowledge
- **Complex**: Requires multiple specialists and careful coordination

#### Assignment Rules by Complexity

**Simple Tasks:**
- Junior Engineer (with review from Senior Engineer)
- Individual specialists in their domain

**Moderate Tasks:**
- Senior Engineer as lead
- Collaboration between 2-3 specialists
- Tech Lead oversight for cross-functional tasks

**Complex Tasks:**
- Tech Lead as coordinator
- Multiple senior specialists
- System Architect involvement for technical design
- Product Manager involvement for scope definition

### Step 3: Consider Dependencies and Timeline

#### High Dependencies
- Involve Tech Lead in coordination
- Create clear handoff procedures
- Regular sync meetings between involved parties

#### Tight Timeline
- Assign to Senior Engineer or most experienced specialist
- Consider parallel work streams
- Daily standup meetings

#### Learning Opportunities
- Pair Junior Engineer with Senior Engineer
- Assign stretch tasks to build skills
- Provide mentoring and regular feedback

## Escalation Guidelines
- If unclear about assignment: consult Tech Lead
- If multiple people claim ownership: Tech Lead decides
- If no one has bandwidth: Product Manager reprioritizes
- If skills gap identified: arrange training or external help
