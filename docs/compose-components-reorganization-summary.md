# Compose Components Reorganization Summary

## What Was Changed

### Before
Components were scattered in the root of `/src/components/`:
```
src/components/
├── compose-component-form.tsx
├── compose-component-grid.tsx
├── compose-preview.tsx
├── kotlin-playground.tsx
└── kotlin-playground/
    ├── kotlin-compose-editor.tsx
    └── kotlin-compose-preview.tsx
```

### After
All Compose-related components are now organized under `/src/components/compose-components/`:
```
src/components/
└── compose-components/
    ├── component-creation-form.tsx    # Was: compose-component-form.tsx
    ├── component-detail-view.tsx      # Was: compose-preview.tsx
    ├── component-grid.tsx             # Was: compose-component-grid.tsx
    ├── kotlin-playground.tsx          # Base playground component
    ├── kotlin-playground/             # Specialized playground components
    │   ├── kotlin-compose-editor.tsx
    │   ├── kotlin-compose-preview.tsx
    │   └── README.md
    ├── index.ts                       # Barrel exports
    └── README.md                      # Component documentation
```

## Component Renames

| Old Name | New Name | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `ComposeComponentForm` | `ComponentCreationForm` | Form for creating new components |
| `ComposePreview` | `ComponentDetailView` | Full view of component with preview and code |
| `ComposeComponentGrid` | `ComposeComponentGrid` | Grid layout (kept same name) |

## Import Updates

### Old Imports
```typescript
import { ComposeComponentForm } from '@/components/compose-component-form'
import { ComposePreview } from '@/components/compose-preview'
import { ComposeComponentGrid } from '@/components/compose-component-grid'
import { KotlinComposeEditor } from '@/components/kotlin-playground/kotlin-compose-editor'
```

### New Imports
```typescript
import { ComponentCreationForm } from '@/components/compose-components/component-creation-form'
import { ComponentDetailView } from '@/components/compose-components/component-detail-view'
import { ComposeComponentGrid } from '@/components/compose-components/component-grid'
import { KotlinComposeEditor } from '@/components/compose-components/kotlin-playground/kotlin-compose-editor'
```

### Using Barrel Imports
```typescript
import { 
  ComponentCreationForm,
  ComponentDetailView,
  ComposeComponentGrid,
  KotlinComposeEditor,
  KotlinComposePreview
} from '@/components/compose-components'
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: All Compose-related components are in one place
2. **Clearer Naming**: Component names better reflect their purpose
3. **Easier Discovery**: Developers can find all related components in one directory
4. **Cleaner Root**: The `/src/components/` directory is less cluttered
5. **Consistent Structure**: Similar components are grouped together

## Updated Files

- All page files that imported these components
- Component documentation headers
- README files
- Component guides

## No Breaking Changes

- All functionality remains the same
- Only file locations and component names changed
- All imports have been updated automatically
