# Fix: Infinite API Loop on Component Detail Page

## Issue #17: Infinite API call loop on component detail page

### Problem Description
The component detail page was experiencing an infinite loop of API calls, continuously calling the view tracking endpoint and stats refresh endpoint at ~100ms intervals. This caused:
- Performance degradation
- Unnecessary database writes
- Increased API costs
- Poor user experience

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by a circular dependency in the React hooks:

1. `ComponentDetailClient.tsx` had a `useEffect` that depended on `trackView`
2. In `useComponentStats.ts`, `trackView` was created with `useCallback` but depended on `stats` 
3. When `trackView` executed, it updated `stats` after calling the API
4. The updated `stats` caused `trackView` to be recreated with a new reference
5. The new `trackView` reference triggered the `useEffect` again
6. Loop continued indefinitely

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added View Tracking Flag (component-detail-client.tsx)
```typescript
const [viewTracked, setViewTracked] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (user && !viewTracked) {
    trackView()
    setViewTracked(true)
  }
}, [user, viewTracked, trackView])
```

This ensures that view tracking only occurs once per component load, regardless of how many times the `trackView` reference changes.

#### 2. Removed Circular Dependencies (useComponentStats.ts)
Changed all state updates in callbacks to use the functional update pattern:

```typescript
// Before - depends on stats
setStats({
  ...stats,
  viewCount: stats.viewCount + 1,
  isViewedByUser: true
})

// After - no dependency on stats
setStats(prevStats => {
  if (prevStats && !prevStats.isViewedByUser) {
    return {
      ...prevStats,
      viewCount: prevStats.viewCount + 1,
      isViewedByUser: true
    }
  }
  return prevStats
})
```

This removes the dependency on `stats` from the callbacks, preventing them from being recreated when stats update.

### Benefits
1. **Performance**: No more continuous API calls
2. **Correctness**: View tracking occurs exactly once per page load
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner dependency chains in hooks
4. **Cost Savings**: Reduced API calls to backend

### Testing Performed
1. ✅ Verified only one POST to `/api/components/[id]/view` on page load
2. ✅ Verified only one GET to `/api/components/[id]/stats` on initial load
3. ✅ Tested favorite toggle - updates stats correctly
4. ✅ Tested download - updates stats correctly
5. ✅ Tested with unauthenticated user - no view tracking occurs
6. ✅ No TypeScript errors
7. ✅ ESLint passes
8. ✅ Production build successful

### Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Be careful with dependencies in `useCallback` and `useEffect`
2. Use functional state updates when the new state depends on the previous state
3. Consider using flags for one-time operations
4. Monitor API calls during development using browser DevTools
