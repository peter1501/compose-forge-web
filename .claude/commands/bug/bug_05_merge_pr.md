## Acting as Tech Lead, Senior Engineer, and DevOps Engineer

I'll manage the final merge process for approved bug fix pull requests, ensuring proper deployment and post-merge validation while maintaining our clean architecture and healthcare compliance standards.

### IMPORTANT ###
ALWAYS base PRs off dev and merge back into dev. main is for release only!!!

### Pre-Merge Validation:

1. **Final Review Verification** (Tech Lead)
   - All required approvals received
   - All review comments resolved
   - CI/CD pipeline successful
   - Security review completed (if required)

2. **Quality Gate Confirmation** (Senior Engineer)
   - All tests passing (100% success rate)
   - Code coverage maintained or improved
   - Performance benchmarks met
   - No new security warnings

3. **Deployment Readiness** (DevOps Engineer)
   - Target branch (`dev`) is stable
   - Deployment pipeline ready
   - Rollback plan confirmed
   - Monitoring systems prepared

### Bug Fix Merge Workflow:

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Merge Checks**

1. **Automated Validation** (System)

### Critical Bug Fast-Track Merge:

For critical production bugs requiring immediate deployment:

#### **Emergency Merge Process**
```bash
# Emergency hotfix merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge hotfix/<critical-bug> --no-ff
git push origin main

# Tag the emergency release
git tag -a emergency-fix-v$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) -m "Emergency fix for critical bug #<issue>"
git push origin emergency-fix-v$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Cherry-pick to dev branch
git checkout dev
git cherry-pick <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin dev
```

#### **Emergency Deployment**
```bash
# Immediate production deployment
npx amplify push --yes

# Monitor deployment
watch -n 5 'npx amplify status'

# Immediate smoke test
curl -f https://your-production-url/health-check
```

### Monitoring and Validation:

#### **Deployment Monitoring Dashboard**
- **Health Checks**: Application availability and response time
- **Error Rates**: Monitor for new errors or increased error rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **User Analytics**: User behavior and feature usage
- **Security Alerts**: Authentication failures, suspicious activity

#### **Post-Deployment Validation**
1. **Automated Testing** (15 minutes post-deployment)
   ```bash
   # Run automated test suite against staging
   npm run test:staging
   
   # Run integration tests
   npm run test:integration:staging
   ```

2. **Manual Validation** (30 minutes post-deployment)
   - Test specific bug fix functionality
   - Verify user workflows
   - Check admin functionality
   - Validate data integrity

3. **Stakeholder Notification** (1 hour post-deployment)
   - Notify product manager of successful deployment
   - Update customer support team
   - Inform security team if security-related
   - Document deployment completion

### Rollback Procedures:

#### **When to Rollback**
- New critical bugs introduced
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Data integrity issues
- HIPAA compliance concerns

#### **Rollback Execution**
```bash
# Quick rollback using git
git checkout dev
git revert <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin dev

# Or rollback to previous release
git reset --hard <previous-stable-commit>
git push --force origin dev

# Trigger emergency deployment
npx amplify push --yes
```
