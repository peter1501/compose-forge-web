## Acting as Senior Engineer, QA Engineer, and System Architect

I'll help you perform comprehensive bug analysis, root cause investigation, and create a detailed resolution plan following our clean architecture principles and healthcare compliance requirements.

### Bug Analysis Workflow:

1. **Bug Reproduction & Documentation** (QA Engineer)
   - Reproduce the issue consistently
   - Document exact steps to reproduce
   - Capture error logs, screenshots, and stack traces
   - Identify affected environments
   - Determine user impact and severity level

2. **Root Cause Investigation** (Senior Engineer)
   - Analyze error logs and stack traces
   - Review recent code changes (git blame, commit history)
   - Identify potential architecture layer violations
   - Check for dependency conflicts or version issues
   - Review database queries and performance issues
   - Validate data integrity and state consistency

3. **System Impact Assessment** (System Architect)
   - Assess impact on clean architecture layers
   - Identify affected components and dependencies
   - Evaluate security implications (especially for healthcare data)
   - Determine HIPAA compliance considerations
   - Plan for data migration if schema changes needed

4. **Resolution Strategy Planning** (All Roles)
   - Design fix approach respecting clean architecture
   - Plan testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Consider rollback strategies
   - Define acceptance criteria for fix validation
   - Estimate complexity and assign appropriate engineer role

### Bug Severity Classification:

#### **Critical (P0)**
- Production system down
- Data corruption or loss
- Security vulnerability
- HIPAA compliance breach
- **Assignment**: Senior Engineer + Security Specialist

#### **High (P1)**
- Core functionality broken
- Significant user impact
- Performance degradation
- **Assignment**: Senior Engineer

#### **Medium (P2)**
- Feature partially broken
- Workaround available
- Minor performance issues
- **Assignment**: Senior Engineer or Junior Engineer (based on complexity)

#### **Low (P3)**
- Cosmetic issues
- Enhancement requests
- Minor usability issues
- **Assignment**: Junior Engineer

  - [ ] Review recent deployments
  - [ ] Check environment-specific configurations
  - [ ] Validate AWS Amplify backend status

- [ ] **Code Analysis**
  - [ ] Recent commits reviewed (last 7 days)
  - [ ] Git blame analysis performed
  - [ ] Code quality metrics checked
  - [ ] Architecture layer boundaries verified

- [ ] **Data Analysis**

### Resolution Planning:

#### **Fix Design Principles**
- **Respect Clean Architecture**: No layer boundary violations
- **Follow Repository Pattern**: Use proper abstractions
- **Maintain Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance
- **Healthcare Compliance**: HIPAA requirements considered
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test strategy

#### **Implementation Strategy**
- **Quick Win**: Immediate temporary fix if critical
- **Proper Fix**: Long-term solution following architecture
- **Preventive Measures**: Additional safeguards or monitoring
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Deliverables:

- **Bug Analysis Report** with:
  - Root cause identification
  - System impact assessment
  - Severity classification
  - Resolution strategy
  - Test plan outline

- **GitHub Issue** with:
  - Detailed bug description
  - Reproduction steps
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment information
  - Acceptance criteria for fix
  - Assigned engineer role

### Execution Commands:

```bash
# Investigate recent changes
git log --oneline --since="7 days ago" --grep="feature\|fix\|refactor"

# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch -a

# Review recent commits affecting specific files
git log --follow -p -- path/to/suspected/file.ts

# Check for conflicts or issues
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test

# Review AWS Amplify status
npx amplify status

# Check application logs
npm run dev # then check browser console and network tab
```

### Investigation Questions:

1. **When did this bug first appear?**
2. **What specific user actions trigger this issue?**
3. **Is this reproducible across different browsers/devices?**
4. **Are there any error messages in the console?**
5. **What recent changes could have introduced this?**
6. **Does this affect specific user roles or all users?**
7. **Is this related to data, UI, or backend functionality?**
8. **What is the business impact of this bug?**

**IMPORTANT**: Always create a GitHub issue with comprehensive analysis before proceeding to implementation. The issue should contain everything needed for the assigned engineer to implement the fix.
