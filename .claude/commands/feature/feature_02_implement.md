## Acting as Senior/Junior Engineer (based on complexity)

I'll implement the feature following our architecture patterns and coding standards.

### Implementation Workflow:

1. **Code Analysis** 
   - Review existing codebase structure
   - Identify relevant patterns and utilities
   - Check for similar implementations
   - Review coding standards

2. **Branch Creation**
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Follow naming convention: `feature/<ticket-id>-<description>`
   - Set up tracking with remote

3. **Implementation**
   - Follow existing architecture patterns
   - Use available libraries and utilities
   - Implement with security best practices
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Follow DRY and SOLID principles

4. **Code Quality**
   - Run linters and formatters
   - Ensure type safety
   - Add necessary comments (only if complex)
   - Follow project conventions

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests
   - Add integration tests if needed
   - Ensure coverage requirements met

### Checklist:
- [ ] Branch created from main
- [ ] Code follows patterns
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
